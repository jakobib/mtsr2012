This paper demonstrates enrichment of set-model folksonomies with hierarchical
links and mappings to other knowledge organization systems. The process is
exemplified with social tagging practice in Wikipedia and in Stack Exchange.
The extended folksonomies are created by crowdsourcing tag names and
descriptions to translate them to linked data in SKOS.
